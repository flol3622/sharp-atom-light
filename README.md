## Minimal File Icons

If you are using the **Minimal** file icons, the dark theme icon variants will be applied because the file icon theme API only provides one `highContrast` property associated with *both* high-contrast dark and high-contrast light themes.

A **High Contrast Minimal** file icon theme is included in this extension that enables support for high-contrast light themes.  
Navigate to File > Preferences > File Icon Theme > **High Contrast Minimal** to apply.
